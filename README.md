# FinalProject
Hello! Welcome to my game, Hopper Run!

If you are anything like me, you're always late to 5th period programming because the hike to hopper is so far. This is what inspired my game.

Objective: survive your run to hopper... but... this becomes harder because you run into you biggest enemy (not in real life, of course) PROFESSOR MWAFFO!!!
Dodge him on your way to class and collect coins to increase your score by 1. Collect an apple power-up and you will speed up for some time and 10 points. 
If you run into the enemy, he eseentially breaks your leg. You have 3 lives. Good luck and have fun!

A special thank you to Anderson Sgiligiano and James Anderson for helping me with some of my code. And also to the rest of my class and Professor Mwaffo 
for making 5th period so fun.
